# What is mooseOS?
mooseOS is a project that will run in your Command Prompt on your Windows install.
# Supported versions of Windows.
- We recommend using Windows 8.1 or later. We can't guarantee support on older versions of Windows, and some features may not work - please report these if you can (it really helps us out with development).
- Using emulators such as DOSBox may not work properly.
- Virtualbox and VMware will work. You can download Windows from here: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
